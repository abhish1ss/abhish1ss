I am 
<span style="font-size:18px">Abhishek Pratap Singh, </span> <br/>
Academically I am a Computer Science graduate and have been working in Backend Development for 4 years. I also have a keen interest in cricket and exploring the latest tech gadgets.
Amongst my projects, what I hold dear is NetHavoc where I developed the experimental conditions to test how a server behaves when it is subjected to extreme usage Because the task was very complex and I had a long-term view of the entire software development value chain.
